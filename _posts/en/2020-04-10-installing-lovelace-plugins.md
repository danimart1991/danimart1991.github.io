This is a good time to learn how to further expand the [*Home Assistant*](https://www.home-assistant.io/) ecosystem by using [*Lovelace*](https://www.home-assistant.io/lovelace/) *Plugins*. These *Plugins* extend our *Dashboards* with custom cards, entities, rows and various options.

Taking the [previous article](/en/pvpc-tariff-prices-in-home-assistant/) in which we learn how to integrate the [*PVPC* (Precio Voluntario al PequeÃ±o Consumidor)](https://www.esios.ree.es/es/pvpc) electric rate, we are going to show the information of the integration in a specific personalized *Lovelace* card that I have made.

> Many *Plugins* can be installed more easily using [*HACS*](https://hacs.xyz/), the manual installation process is detailed below.

## Download the Plugin

The first thing is to get the *Plugin*. Usually this is a *JavaScript* (`*.js`) file, in our example `pvpc-hourly-pricing-card.js`.

To do this, access the repository page where the card development is located, typically [*GitHub*](https://github.com). In the example case: [https://github.com/danimart1991/pvpc-hourly-pricing-card](https://github.com/danimart1991/pvpc-hourly-pricing-card).

### Alternative 1

Once inside, many developers perform deployments when they consider that they have a stable version with important changes. This option will be available from the **Releases** section.

From the **Releases** page you can download different versions of the *JavaScript* files.

### Alternative 2

At other times, we'll have to search the repository for the *JavaScript* file.

Once inside the file detail page, look for the ***RAW*** button, right click on it, and press "*Save file as...*".

## Installation

Place the file inside the folder of your choice as long as it is inside the `/config/www/` folder. For example `/config/www/pvpc-hourly-pricing-card.js` or `/config/www/pvpc-hourly-pricing-card/pvpc-hourly-pricing-card.js`.

### In Home Assistant 0.107 or higher

The visual installation is available via the menu *Configuration -> Lovelace Dashboards -> Resources*.

![Resources section](/assets/posts/en/installing-lovelace-plugins/resources-page.jpg)

Click on the add (***+***) button and fill in the data. The url is the address where you have placed the file by replacing `/www/` with `/local/`. Add after the address: `?v=0.0.1`.

![Add resource](/assets/posts/en/installing-lovelace-plugins/add-resource.jpg)

The alternative is to install the *Plugin* by including it inside the `lovelace` node in the `configuration.yaml` file.

```yaml
lovelace:
  resources:
    - url: /local/plugins/pvpc-hourly-pricing-card.js?v=0.0.1
      type: module
```

Refresh the page in your browser.

### In earlier versions of Home Assistant 0.107

If you are using *Lovelace* in Visual mode. You can include the resources from the edit menu (top right) and once again, from the same point, enter the option "*Edit RAW configuration*".

```yaml
title: "Home"
resources:
  - url: /local/pvpc-hourly-pricing-card.js?v=0.0.1
    type: module
views:
  ...
```

If you are using *Lovelace* in *YAML* mode, just add the resources node in the `ui-lovelace.yaml` file.

## Versions

You may have noticed how after each file path I include the text `?v=0.0.1`. The version of the deployment must be included to avoid that with each change the browser keeps the previous JavaScript file in cache. That is, when the developer updates the *Plugin*, it will be necessary to download and replace the old file on our server. When doing this, it is possible that many browsers or even the *Home Assistant* application use the file saved in the local cache and not the new version, to force the use of the new file, the trick is to change the version when we indicate the path. It doesn't matter that it's not real, just that it's different each time.

## Using the Plugin

This is a point that depends a lot on the installed *Plugin*. It is time to read the available documentation and follow the steps.

## Conclusion

Now you can easily extend the functionalities and the interface of *Home Assistant* and as it is the case, use specific cards to take full advantage of the different integrations.

This and other articles complement the documentation of the [***GitHub* repository**](https://github.com/danimart1991/home-assistant-config) where all the configuration of my house is available.
