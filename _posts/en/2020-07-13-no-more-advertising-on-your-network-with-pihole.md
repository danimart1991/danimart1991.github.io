Many of us have some kind of advertising blocker in our web browsers (*Adblock*, *uBlock*...). One of the biggest problems that this solution poses is the difficult installation of these same blockers in some devices such as *Smart TVs*, or that for example in mobile, the blocking is only done at the browser level, but not at the level of the rest of the applications.

In addition, there are other annoying components such as malware and telemetry that many programs or web pages use too often and are difficult to avoid.

A far more effective way to avoid all this unpleasant content is to use blockers that act at the network level and not just on each device. This way we save on setting up all the devices in the house and make sure our network is clean. Thanks to [***JASimancas***](https://github.com/jasimancas) (JosÃ© Antonio Simancas), I was able to meet and test [***Pi-hole***](https://pi-hole.net/), one of the most used.

Using a [*Raspberry Pi*](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), let's set up from scratch: *Raspberry Pi OS* + *Pi-hole* + Recommended lists.

## Requirements

- A *Raspberry Pi*
- A SD Card
- A computer to create an image on the SD card.
- **(Recommendation)** Connect a network cable to the *Raspberry Pi*.

## Installing Raspberry Pi OS

The first thing is to install ***Raspberry Pi OS*** (formerly *Raspbian*) on the *Raspberry Pi*. If you have another *Linux*-based operating system or another device already configured, you can skip to the next section directly.

Steps:

1. [**Download *Raspberry Pi Imager***](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) compatible with your computer's operating system.

    > Although the article will use *Raspberry Pi Imager* for *Windows*. All versions are similar.

2. **Insert the SD card** in your computer.

3. Install and open *Raspberry Pi Imager* and select the **Operating System** of your choice:

    | | |
    | --- | --- |
    | *Raspberry Pi OS (32-bit)* | With graphic environment |
    | *Raspberry Pi OS Lite (32-bit)* | Without graphic environment (The one I will use in this article) |
    | *Raspberry Pi OS Full (32-bit)* |  With graphic environment and recommended applications |

4. Select the SD card and click **Write**.

5. Once finished, **open with the file explorer** the recently recorded card and inside create a file called `ssh` without extension or content.

    ![SD Card - File SSH](/assets/posts/en/no-more-advertising-on-your-network-with-pihole/sd-card-ssh.jpg)

6. **Insert the SD card into the *Raspberry Pi*** and plug it into the power supply.

7. Let a few minutes pass and from the computer, try to connect via ***SSH*** using the *IP* assigned automatically by the *Router* or with `raspberrypi.local` using the user `pi`. The default password is `raspberry`.

    ```bash
    C:\Users\danimart1991> ssh pi@192.168.1.204
    password: raspberry
    ```

8. Once inside, **execute the command** `sudo raspi-config`.

    1. Select ***Update*** to update the repositories and the system.
    2. Select ***Change User Password*** to change the *pi* user password to a more secure one.

9. Run `sudo reboot` to **restart the *Raspberry*** and apply the changes..

## Installing Pi-hole

Then, to **install *Pi-hole***, simply run the following command and follow the steps.

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.pi-hole.net | bash
```

The first is to **select the *DNS* provider**, that is, *Pi-hole* will capture the requests made on our network and use this provider to resolve the addresses on the corresponding *IP* by filtering out the malicious ones. Either option is good.

![DNS Provider](/assets/posts/en/no-more-advertising-on-your-network-with-pihole/dns-provider.jpg)

Accept the default lists (we will change them later).

![Listas Comunes](/assets/posts/en/no-more-advertising-on-your-network-with-pihole/common-lists.jpg)

Then accept the *IPv4* and *IPv6* blocking.

And on the next screen, **VERY IMPORTANT**, choose the static (fixed) *IP* you want to use on the *Raspberry Pi*. This *IP* will then be used as the *DNS* provider on the rest of the devices.

You can use the default one or change it for another one. For the article, `192.168.1.3` has been selected.

![Static IP setting](/assets/posts/en/no-more-advertising-on-your-network-with-pihole/fixed-ip.jpg)

Indicate on the subsequent screens:

- You want to use the web interface for administrators. **(Option 0)**
- Activate the Web server. **(Option 0)**
- Keep a record of queries. **(Option 0)**
- Show all in *FTL* privacy mode. **(Option 0)**

Wait a bit...

![Installation Completed](/assets/posts/en/no-more-advertising-on-your-network-with-pihole/installation-complete.jpg)

The last window will show you the information of the *DNS* server created, as well as the data to access the Web client and its password. Write down everything.

## Pi-hole Admin Console

From now on, the rest of Pi-hole's configuration can be done from the web panel available at the web address the installation have indicated in the previous window (`http://192.168.1.3/admin`). you can access it from a browser and enter the password by clicking on **Login**.

![Pi-hole login](/assets/posts/en/no-more-advertising-on-your-network-with-pihole/login.jpg)

Once inside you will access the data display panel.

![Dashboard](/assets/posts/en/no-more-advertising-on-your-network-with-pihole/dashboard.jpg)

## Setting up the network

You will have to make all devices on the network have the *IP* of the *Raspberry Pi* itself configured as the *DNS* server address that we have used as the *DNS* server.

The easiest way is to have *Router* itself set this *IP*. To do this, read the manual of your *Router*, access the section of *DNS* configuration and change the *Internet* provider *DNS* server address with the *IP* of your *DNS* server (*Raspberry Pi*).

![Router DNS Server](/assets/posts/en/no-more-advertising-on-your-network-with-pihole/router-dns-server.jpg)

When devices with automatic *IP* are rebooted, they will automatically get the address of the new *DNS* server. The same for those with a reserved *IP* in Router.

For those with a static (fixed) *IP* configured manually on the device itself, the primary *DNS* must be changed in the configuration.

![Manual DNS configuration](/assets/posts/en/no-more-advertising-on-your-network-with-pihole/manual-dns-management.jpg)

From the `Network` section of the *Pi-hole* web panel we can see which devices are connected to the network and which ones are using *Pi-hole* as a filter.

## Updating Lists

From the `Group Management -> Adlists` section you can modify the lists that *Pi-hole* uses to allow or block addresses.

![Lists management](/assets/posts/en/no-more-advertising-on-your-network-with-pihole/lists.jpg)

Although there are many websites on the *Internet* that are dedicated to collecting lists, my personal recommendation is to use the lists that appear in green in [***Firebog***](https://firebog.net/) and every few months, go back and check if there are new lists available. The lists themselves are self-updating, so there is no need to reconfigure them, even if contributors add or remove domains within them.

Once changed, it is **VERY** advisable to click on `Tools -> Update Gravity` to perform a lists update and compression.

## Backing up

One of the most important things once everything is set up is to **make backups**, so that in case of any critical failure we can make a restore and let everything work again.

*Pi-hole* makes this task much easier from its *Web Panel*, section `Settings -> Teleporter`.

![Teleporter](/assets/posts/en/no-more-advertising-on-your-network-with-pihole/teleporter.jpg)

From here, as simple as two options, export configuration and import configuration (or some specific part).

It is recommended to make a backup with every major change or before every update of *Pi-hole* or the main operating system (*Raspberry Pi OS*).

## Conclusion

![Conclusion](/assets/posts/en/no-more-advertising-on-your-network-with-pihole/conclusion.jpg)

From now on **your network will be free from malicious domains**, especially advertising. Everything in a simple way and without the need to configure each device separately. We have installed *Raspberry Pi OS* and *Pi-hole* and there is still much to explore of these tools, but we will see that later.
